# MIDDLEWARE SUPERVISOR SignalFx detectors

## How to use this module

```hcl
module "signalfx-detectors-middleware-supervisor" {
  source      = "github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors.git//middleware/supervisor?ref={revision}"

  environment = var.environment
  notifications = var.notifications
}

```

## Purpose

Creates SignalFx detectors with the following checks:

- Supervisor process state
- Supervisor heartbeat
