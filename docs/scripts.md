the developer or even the user.

All scripts are split into different directories. The [/Makefile](../Makefile)
and the CI both use these scripts to automate automation over changes depending
on its type.

### Module

The scripts in [/scripts/module](../scripts/module) are related to automation on
detectors modules in the repository and so often used for development purpose.

One special script is the
[loop_wrapper.sh](../scripts/module/loop_wrapper.sh) script used in combination with
another "atomic" script to apply it on all modules (often used for `make` commands).

### Stack

The scripts in [/scripts/stack](../scripts/stack) are related to automation on
terraform stacks to use this repository for its project. They allow generate code
in [/examples/](../examples) directory.

They are often used by the end user to work with this repository and generate a pre
configured stack. The `make init-stack` command for example used in the CI to deploy
all monitors allow to generate a fresh stack with all modules configured in
[/examples/stack](../examples/stack).it.

### Templates

Jinja2 based templates are available in [/scripts/templates](../scripts/templates)
and are used in combination with a Jinja2 renderer to generate code.
