# Developer's Guide

In most cases you will have to run scripts to automatically update existing files in this
repository after a change to apply all these dependencies and pass the CI.

For example, to update the readme of one detectors module you will have to:
* edit its corresponding yaml configuration file
* generate the markdown readme file from the jinja template

The CI will always try to regenerate code from current configurations so if one of them
is no longer "sync" it will trigger an error.

The environment used by the CI should be used by the developer to take advantage of a common
automation processes producing the same consistent result and allow us to apply global
rules and templates homogeneous to all modules.

## Requirements

First of all you have to [setup your environment](./environment.md) to have every required
dependencies available to run useful commands detailed below.

You should get a ready environment where you can run `make` commands or directly use the underlying
[scripts](./scripts.md) or even some tools available in the container like `doctoc` or `j2`.

## TLDR

This documentation tries to be exhaustive and describe each:

* atomic `make` targets (which use helper scripts to automate)
* check done by the CI which should be success
* common type of change possible on this repository

It allows to understand and link what type of change requires what `make` target to pass
the corresponding CI check.

Most of contributions are related to [detectors change type](#detectors) and do no require
to fully understand and know all possible targets, scripts and check.

The essential things to know are:

* that lot of the files are auto generated and checked by the CI so you have to respect this
* to never edit a `*-gen*` file or the `README.md` in modules, update its underlying yaml
configuration files in `conf/` directory of the module.
* as soon as you make any change on a module, run `make update-module` command to update every
generated files

### Bootstrap a new module

A common contribution which cover most of detectors related changes is the creation of a
new module of detectors.

```bash
# First, enter in the docker based environment as seen in requirements above
make

# Set required input information as environment variables
SOURCE_TYPE="smart-agent" # or "internal", "integration", "organization", "otel-collector"
MODULE_NAME="my-new-module" # use dash separated word to name your module
MODULE_DIR="${SOURCE_TYPE}_${MODULE_NAME}" # the directory is source+name underscore separated
METRIC_NAME="my_metric_used_for_heartbeat_detector"

# Init a new module creating ready directory to welcome detectors
make init-module ${MODULE_DIR} # same as "make init-module ${SOURCE_TYPE} ${MODULE_NAME}"

# Create a new detector using the heartbeat sample configuration and updating module and metric
cp scripts/templates/examples/heartbeat-simple.yaml modules/${MODULE_DIR}/conf/00-heartbeat.yaml
sed -i "s/^\(module:\).*$/\1 ${MODULE_NAME}/" modules/${MODULE_DIR}/conf/00-heartbeat.yaml
sed -i "s/^\([[:space:]]*metric:\).*$/\1 \"${METRIC_NAME}\"/" modules/${MODULE_DIR}/conf/00-heartbeat.yaml

# Full update the module (doc, terraform code, add/remove/change detectors...)
make update-module ${MODULE_DIR}
```

Congratulations, you just created a working and minimal module!

Now you can edit the yaml configuration files available in its `conf` directory and run again `make update-module`
command every time you want update the underlying code and documentation before to push your changes.

For more information about the templates and their generator please check the [dedicated readme](../scripts/templates/README.md).
You can find a full list of options for the detector template from the [values.yaml](../scripts/templates/values.yaml)
which is similar to an helm chart.

The rest of this documentation will cover accurately for each kind of change you want apply the related
command(s) to use in this development environment but the `update-module` should cover any kind of changes.

## Commands

You have seen above the `update-module` and `init-module` `make` targets which should be enough
in most of the cases.

For a full list of available `make` targets please see [environment](./environment.md#Commands)
documentation. The most used commands for developer are `dev`, `init-module`, `update-module` and
`clean`.

### Examples

- `make update-module *system*` to full update only matching modules like `smart-agent_system-common`
- `make update-module` to full update all modules
- `make update-module-doc *system*` to only update the doc of the modules matching `*system*` pattern

## Change types

There are different automation tasks to perform depending on the change done in this repository.

### Documentation

__Label__:
[documentation](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/labels/documentation)

__Check__:
[Documentation](#documentation-1)

* Table of contents of all readmes are automatically committed from the CI but you can run
`make update-toc`. It uses [doctoc](https://github.com/thlorenz/doctoc) under the hood so you can
also run `doctoc --github --title ':link: **Contents**' --maxlevel 3` on a specific module.

* To update readme(s) of detectors modules you have to edit its underlying configuration
available in `conf/readme.yaml` of the module directory. Then you must run `make update-module-doc`
to regenerate readmes. It uses the module [gen_doc.sh](../scripts/module/gen_doc.sh) script
under the hood so you also use it to update only one module provided as parameter.

### Detectors

__Label__:
[detectors](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/labels/detectors)

__Check__:
[Detectors](#detectors-1)

* To update an existing detector located in a `detectors-gen.tf` file so you have, as for readme,
to edit the right configuration file located `conf/[0-9][0-9]-*.yaml` in its module directory.
Then you will have to run `make update-module-detectors` to regenerate the code. It uses the module
[gen_detectors.sh](../scripts/module/gen_detectors.sh) under the hood so you can
also use it to update only one module provided as parameter.

* To update an existing detector not located in a `detectors-gen.tf` file so you can directly
edit the terraform code in its tf file.

* To add a new detector to an existing module you can use the [j2 based
generator](../scripts/templates/README.md) adding a new yaml configuration file in the module directory
`conf/` with the prefix `[0-9][0-9]-` like `conf/00-my_first_detector.yaml` then run `make update-module`
because this change should affect all tf files (outputs included) and the module documentation.

* In some cases you do not want use the generator or it does not provide all capabilities you need.
So you can implement it manually in another file than `detectors-gen.tf` reusing and improving
the code generated by the generator. You can also create it from scratch but you must follow our
[templating](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Templating) model (you
can follow an existing detector). In this case no need to update the tf code but you still need to
update the documentation of the module `make update-module-doc`.

* To remove an existing detector, first think if lower severity, changing thresholds or functions
could not improve it enough. If it is still not relevant or generate too many alerts in some
scenarios but remain useful in others may be disabling it by default is a good idea. Finally, if
the detector simply does not make sens so you can remove it. If it is located in `detectors-gen.tf`
file so simply `git rm conf/42-the_detector.yaml` and run `make update-module`. Else, you have to
manually remove the resource code in `detectors-?.tf` file and all its related variables in
`variables.tf`.

* To add a new module you should use `make init-module source_module` where `source` is one of known
sources (`internal`, `organization`, `smart-agent`, `otel-collector`, `integration`) and `module`
is the name of your module like `mysql` or `nginx`. It will create a new directory
`[source]_[module]` in [/modules](../modules) directory. The you can add new detector (see above) inside.
For `integration` sources, we prefix its name in `module` like `aws-alb` or `gcp-cloud-sql` and
it is often needed to remove the `common-modules.tf` to not use the default [filtering
convention](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Tagging-convention)
which is often not possible (i.e. `aws` integration prefix all dimensions with `aws_tag_` the `env`
becomes `aws_tag_env`.

### Templating

__Label__:
[templating](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/labels/templating)

__Check__:
[Generator](#generator)

If you evolution on our [templating](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Templating)
model or the modules [structure](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Structure)
you will have to update existing documentation in markdown files of this repository starting by
this one but also any relevant [wiki](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki) pages.

You will also have to apply the evolution on the full existing code base so if you want to add a feature
implemented everywhere.

Every single and tiny change in these templating rules must be spread to the entire repository on
all modules and their detectors. This could be difficult to automate, source of mistakes and have
undesired side effects.

If you want to implement a special feature for a specific module this is [detectors](#detectors) change
type you can go ahead.

But for feature common to all modules you will also probably need to update the [j2 based
generator](../scripts/templates/README.md) to
support this new "rule".

Also in some cases it is recommended to add a new [checks](#checks) / job to the CI if relevant.

## Checks

The CI is broken down into 3 workflows. Each one run different jobs and all of them will
failed for any error meet (i.e. change detected). All are required and must pass to merge.

### Detectors

The [Detectors](../.github/workflows/main.yml) workflow is dedicated to test terraform code related to
detectors in modules. It contains different jobs:

* __deployment__: terraform `fmt`, `validate` and `apply all` detectors from all modules bootstrapping
an example stack and importing all modules. It consists of `make init-stack && terraform apply examples/stack`.

* __compliance__: check and lint the terraform code. It consists of `make module-check` which use
[tflint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint/) tool to check common terraform errors that
`validate` does not find like [unused
declarations](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint/blob/master/docs/rules/terraform_unused_declarations.md).

* __outputs__: regenerates the detectors terraform outputs listing all resources in the modules
to ensure outputs are up to date. It consists of `make update-module-outputs`.

* __gen__: regenerates the detectors terraform resources and variables from their preset yaml
configuration using the jinja based generator to ensure the configuration and code are "sync". It
consists of `make update-module-detectors`.

### Documentation

The [Documentation](../.github/workflows/doc.yml) workflow is dedicated to update table of contents
and check that generated documentation. It contains different jobs:

* __toc__: runs [DocToc](https://github.com/thlorenz/doctoc) to generate table of contents on
all readmes in the repository. It consists of `make update-toc` but this job automatically push commits
over your changes to update toc so it is not required to run this command manually.

* __spellcheck__: runs [PySpelling](https://facelessuser.github.io/pyspelling/) to find any typos
in markdown files.

* __dead-links__: uses [markdown-link-check](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/markdown-link-check)
to find any broken links in markdown files.

### Generator

The [Generator](../.github/workflows/generator.yml) workflow is dedicated to test the j2 based
detectors generator which help the developer to create new detectors.

This generator is also used in the `gen` job of the `Detectors` workflow to regenerate
all pre-configured detectors code.

There is only one job `test` which:

* create a new "fake" module using `make init-module` in [/modules](../modules) directory.
* generate detectors resources and variables thanks to the generator using all available
example configurations from [/scripts/templates/examples](../scripts/templates/examples)
directory.
* import the "fake" module into the ready example stack
[detectors.tf](../examples/stack/detectors.tf) next to the existing static import.
* deploy the [/examples/stack](../examples/stack) to validate full process of creating a
new module and generating detectors.
