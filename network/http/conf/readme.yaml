  There is no SignalFx official integration for `http` but there is still a 
  [monitor](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/monitors/http.html) to use.

  ### Monitors

  This monitor is only available from agent version `>= 5.2.0` but it has evolved since and we 
  recommend to use at least version `v5.5.6`.

  Check the examples in the official monitor documentation and the Notes section below.

notes: |
  This module creates some detectors to check web urls and optionally their associated tls certificates.

  * By default, `signalfx-agent` collection interval is `10s`. Depending of webservices 
  checked this could dangerous or useless to requet them as often so you can change 
  `intervalSeconds` monitor(s) parameter as you prefer.

  * The transformation allows to adapt sensitivity applying its function on a timeframe
  which will change the evaluated value. The alert will be raised as soon the conditions are
  met but comapared to a transformed value not true to reality and obviously more favorable.
  This also affect the chart which could be not desired especially for troubleshooting
  (webchecks often require accuracy). I.e. `max(over='15m')` on `http_code_matched` will
  always be OK (`1`) on alert (and so chart also) even if more than `50%` of checks done
  on the timeframe are failed.

  * The `lasting` function does not change the value. It could apply on an evaluated value
  different from the orginal (i.e. if you set `transformation_function` explicitely).
  The chart will show the exact real value and even alert condition itself will be met
  strictly immediately but alert will be raised only at the end of lasting timeframe
  if the conditions have always remained.

  * The `http.code_matched` and `http.regex.matched` based detectors are the most critical
  They have only one severity (`Critical`) and use `lasting` function in addition to usual
  transformation function (by default, not set only for them) which could affect 
  their "sensitivity".

  * By default, this module will raise alerts these detectors with moderate sensitivity in 
  combination with `10s` collection interval and `lasting('60s')`: `6` datapoints for 1m
  so the webcheck could fail 5 consecutive times before raising alert.

  * Feel free to use variables to adapt this sensitivity depending of your needs to make 
  detectors more tolerant (increasing lasting timeframe or even adding transformation) or
  more strict (decreasing lasting timeframe or changing transformation function from `max`
  to `min`).

  * If you have multiple webhecks which require different sensitivity level so you can add
  common dimension using `addExtraDimensions` to set of similar monitors on agent. Then,
  you can import as many times this module with different value for `filter_custom_*` variables 
  to match these different dimension(s) value(s).

  * The certificate metrics will be collected only if `useHTTPS: true` (or if using the
  deprecated `urls`) monitor option AND if the website supports and redirects `https`.

  * The `http_content_length` based detector is disabled by default because not considered
  as generic purpose but `disabled` variables allow to change this.
