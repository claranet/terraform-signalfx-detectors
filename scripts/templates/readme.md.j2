## How to use this module?

This directory defines a [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
[module](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/usage.html) you can use in your
existing [stack](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Getting-started#stack) by adding a
`module` configuration and setting its `source` parameter to URL of this folder:

```hcl
{{ tf }}
```

Note the following parameters:

* `source`: Use this parameter to specify the URL of the module. The double slash (`//`) is intentional  and required.
  Terraform uses it to specify subfolders within a Git repo (see [module
  sources](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/sources.html)). The `ref` parameter specifies a specific Git tag in
  this repository. It is recommended to use the latest "pinned" version in place of `{revision}`. Avoid using a branch
  like `master` except for testing purpose. Note that every modules in this repository are available on the Terraform
  [registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/claranet/detectors/signalfx) and we recommend using it as source
  instead of `git` which is more flexible but less future-proof.

* `environment`: Use this parameter to specify the
  [environment](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Getting-started#environment) used by this
  instance of the module.
  Its value will be added to the `prefixes` list at the start of the [detector
  name](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Templating#example).
  In general, it will also be used in the `filtering` internal sub-module to [apply
  filters](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Guidance#filtering) based on our default
  [tagging convention](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Tagging-convention) by default.

* `notifications`: Use this parameter to define where alerts should be sent depending on their severity. It consists
  of a Terraform [object](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/types.html#object-) where each key represents an available
  [detector rule severity](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/alerts-detectors-notifications/create-detectors-for-alerts.html#severity)
  and its value is a list of recipients. Every recipients must respect the [detector notification
  format](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/splunk-terraform/signalfx/latest/docs/resources/detector#notification-format).
  Check the [notification binding](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Notifications-binding)
  documentation to understand the recommended role of each severity.

These 3 parameters alongs with all variables defined in [common-variables.tf](common-variables.tf) are common to all
[modules](../) in this repository. Other variables, specific to this module, are available in
{% for var_file in var_files %}{% if var_files|length > 1 and not loop.first %} and {% endif %}[{{ var_file }}]({{ var_file }}){% endfor %}.
In general, the default configuration "works" but all of these Terraform
[variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html) make it possible to
customize the detectors behavior to better fit your needs.

Most of them represent usual tips and rules detailled in the
[guidance](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Guidance) documentation and listed in the
common [variables](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Variables) dedicated documentation.

Feel free to explore the [wiki](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki) for more information about
general usage of this repository.

## What are the available detectors in this module?

This module creates the following SignalFx detectors which could contain one or multiple alerting rules:

{{ detectors }}

## How to collect required metrics?

This module deploys detectors using metrics reported by the
{% if source_type == 'smart-agent' -%}
[SignalFx Smart Agent Monitors](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent#monitors).

Even if the [Smart Agent is deprecated](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/main/docs/smartagent-deprecation-notice.md)
it remains an efficient, lightweight and simple monitoring agent which still works fine.
See the [official documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/smart-agent/smart-agent-resources.html) for more information
about this agent.
You might find the related following documentations useful:
- the global level [agent configuration](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/main/docs/config-schema.md)
- the [monitor level configuration](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/main/docs/monitor-config.md)
- the internal [agent configuration tips](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Guidance#agent-configuration).
- the full list of [monitors available](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/docs/monitors) with their own specific documentation.

In addition, all of these monitors are still available in the [Splunk Otel Collector](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector),
the Splunk [distro of OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/distributions/) which replaces SignalFx Smart Agent,
thanks to the internal [Smart Agent Receiver](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/tree/main/internal/receiver/smartagentreceiver).

As a result:
- any SignalFx Smart Agent monitor are compatible with the new agent OpenTelemetry Collector and related modules in this repository keep `smart-agent` as source name.
- any OpenTelemetry receiver not based on an existing Smart Agent monitor is not available from old agent so related modules in this repository use `otel-collector` as source name.
{% elif source_type == 'otel-collector' -%}
[Receivers](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/master/receiver/README.md) of the [OpenTelemetry
Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/), a new vendor-agnostic agent which replaces the [SignalFx Smart
Agent](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/) in Splunk Observability (fka SignalFx).

It is surely more powerful but therefore more complex so give a look to the [official documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/)
to learn how to configure Otel Collector and your receivers properly.

The full list of available receivers are distributed through different sources:
- the [officially supported receivers](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/receiver) from the core repository
- the [contributions based receivers](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver) which represents
a superset of the core repository.
- the [splunk specific receivers](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/tree/main/internal/receiver) from the Splunk distro of
the OpenTelemetry Collector based on the contributions repository.
{% elif source_type == 'prometheus-exporter' -%}
scraping of a server following the [OpenMetrics convention](https://openmetrics.io/) based on and compatible with [the Prometheus
exposition format](https://github.com/prometheus/docs/blob/main/content/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats.md#openmetrics-text-format).

They are generally called `Prometheus Exporters` which can be fetched by both the [SignalFx Smart Agent](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent)
thanks to its [prometheus exporter monitor](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/main/docs/monitors/prometheus-exporter.md) and the
[OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector) using its [prometheus
receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/prometheusreceiver) or its derivates.

These exporters could be embedded directly in the tool you want to monitor (e.g. nginx ingress) or must be installed next to it as
a separate program configured to connect, create metrics and expose them as server.
{% elif source_type == 'fame' -%}
the [Function for Azure Monitoring Extension](https://github.com/claranet/fame), an Azure Function App written in Python by Claranet
which allows to run Log Analytics queries and send result to Splunk Observability as metrics.

More information available in the [dedicated readme](https://github.com/claranet/fame/blob/master/README.md).

### Metrics

{% if source_type == 'smart-agent' %}
To filter only required metrics for the detectors of this module, add the
[datapointsToExclude](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/gdi/smart-agent/smart-agent-resources.html#filtering-data-using-the-smart-agent)
parameter to the corresponding monitor configuration:

```yaml
    datapointsToExclude:
      - metricNames:
        - '*'
{%- else %}
Here is the list of required metrics for detectors in this module.
