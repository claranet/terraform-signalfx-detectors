## 🥅 Goal

This project aims to speed up alerting deployment and apply infrastructure as code
process to your monitoring. It could also be a place to collect, share and improve
alerting rules on popular services and environments through SignalFx and Terraform.

__Note__: These templates implementation is opinionated and enforce best practices
which ensure homogeneity but it will also restrict the usage and capabilities even
if it tries to provide as much flexibility as possible.

## 📦 Modules

This repository consists in a collection of generic pre-built detectors for SignalFx
broken down into multiple terraform modules in [modules](./modules/README.md) directory.

Each module is fully independent and it is dedicated to monitor one service
thanks to the metrics and information it provides. It contains:

- Terraform source code to be use as module
- Readme file containing instructions and specific notes to work with the module.
- Source, dependencies and sample configuration for metrics collection.

## 🚀 Usage

A module is a collection of [detectors
resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/splunk-terraform/signalfx/latest/docs/resources/detector)
with global and per-detector variables available to adapt the default alerting
behavior to suit your requirements changing the underlying detectors configuration
at deployment thanks to Terraform.
