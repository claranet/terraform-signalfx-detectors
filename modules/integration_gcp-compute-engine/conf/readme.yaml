  ### Metadata configuration for default filtering

  While SignalFx does not support `label` sync from GCE the default filtering policy relies on `metadata` instead.
  Therefore, if you keep the default filter (if you don't define `filtering_custom` variable) you **need** to add those metadata to your GCP computes instances :

  * sfx_env=true
  * sfx_monitored=true

  For example:

  * via gcloud, at the instance level:
    ```
    gcloud compute instances add-metadata myinstance --zone=europe-west1-c --metadata sfx_env=true
    gcloud compute instances add-metadata myinstance --zone=europe-west1-c --metadata sfx_monitored=true
    ```
  * via terraform, [at the instance level](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/compute_instance#metadata)
  * via terraform, [at the project level](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/compute_project_metadata)

  You also **need** to check if those metadata are in the metadata `includeList` in your [SignalFx GCP
  integration](https://dev.splunk.com/observability/docs/integrations/gcp_integration_overview/#Optional-fields).
  You can configure this from [Claranet Terraform module for GCP
  integration](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-integrations/tree/master/cloud/gcp#input_gcp_compute_metadata_whitelist).

  ### About disk detectors

  Detectors "GCP GCE Instance disk .." defines an explicit aggregation function by default in contrast to other detectors. It is because underlying metrics about throttle can
  add optional `throttle_reason` dimension which will not exist on not throttle related metrics (used to calculate the percentage). To make them match we have to group on dimensions
  __common__ between both metrics.
  So, if you want to overwrite `disk_throttled_bps_aggregation_function` or `disk_throttled_ops_notifications` take care to keep the aggregation by 'instance_name' and 'device_name', else you might break the detector.

  Notice these detectors has a `device_name` dimension in addition to `instance_name` compared to other detectors because it's possible to have two alertes on the same instance if this instance have two disks.
