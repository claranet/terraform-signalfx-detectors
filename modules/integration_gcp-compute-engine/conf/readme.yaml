  ### metadata to add and allow

  While SignalFx does not support `label` sync from GCE the default filtering policy relies on `metadata` instead.
  Therefore, if you keep the default filter (if you don't define `filter_custom_includes` or `filter_custom_excludes`) you **need** to add those metadata to your GCP computes instances :

  * sfx_env=true
  * sfx_monitored=true

  For example:

  * via gcloud, at the instance level:
    ```
    gcloud compute instances add-metadata myinstance --zone=europe-west1-c --metadata sfx_env=true
    gcloud compute instances add-metadata myinstance --zone=europe-west1-c --metadata sfx_monitored=true
    ```
  * via terraform, [at the instance level](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/compute_instance#metadata)
  * via terraform, [at the project level](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/compute_project_metadata)

  You also **need** to check if those metadata are in the metadata whitelist in your signalfx GCP integration, see https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/google-cloud-platform.html#compute-engine-instance.

  ### detectors GCP GCE Instance disk …

  Detectors "GCP GCE Instance disk …", compared to other detectors, are bound (aggregated) to instance and device.
  In other words, those detectors track de behavior of each instance's device.
  It's possible to have two alertes on the same instance if this instance have two disks.

  If you want to overwrite `disk_throttled_bps_aggregation_function` or `disk_throttled_ops_notifications` take care to keep the aggregation by 'instance_name' and 'device_name', else you might break the detector.
