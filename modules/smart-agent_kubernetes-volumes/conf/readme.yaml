  ### Agent

  Here is the official [main
  documentation](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/integrations-reference/integrations.kubernetes.html) for
  kubernetes including the `signalfx-agent` installation which must be installed as
  [daemonset](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/) on your cluster.

  ### Monitors

  The detectors in this module are based on metrics reported by the following monitors:

  * [kubernetes-volumes](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/monitors/kubernetes-volumes.html)

  The `kubernetes-volumes` monitor does support non persistent volume types filtered out in this module before
  `signalfx-agent` `v5.3.2` version.

  [Others](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-monitors-observers.html#monitors-observers)
  exist to increase visibility or may be in future to enrich this modules or create new ones.

  The `kubernetes-volumes` requires to enable the following `extraMetrics`:

  * `kubernetes.volume_inodes`
  * `kubernetes.volume_inodes_free`

  It requires to give to the agent the authorization to read `persistentvolumes`. See examples below
  to configure its role.

  ### Examples

  Here is a sample configuration fragment for the SignalFx agent's cluster role:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
  kind: ClusterRole
  metadata:
    labels:
      app: signalfx-agent
    name: signalfx-agent
  rules:
  - apiGroups:
    - ""
    resources:
    - persistentvolumes
    - persistentvolumeclaims
    verbs:
    - get
    - list
    - watch
  ...
  ```

  Using the SignalFx [Helm](https://helm.sh/) [chart](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/deployments/k8s/helm/signalfx-agent)
  could ease the agent installation and configuration. Only need to enable `gatherVolumesMetrics` option available from version `1.6.0`.


notes: |
  * In addition to the base permissions granted to the cluster role associated to the SignalFx Agent's service account in the official Helm Chart,
  it must also have the `get`, `list` and `watch` on `persistentvolumes` and `persistentvolumeclaim` resources.

  * If you use the [Helm chart](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/deployments/k8s/helm/signalfx-agent)
  to deploy the agent, so you need chart version `>= 1.5.0` and enable `gatherVolumesMetrics: true` in `values.yml`.
