  Follow the
  [docker-container-stats](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/monitors/docker-container-stats.html)
  monitor configuration to collect metrics.

  It requires to enable the following `extraMetrics`:

  * `cpu.percent`
  * `cpu.throttling_data.throttled_time`

notes: |
  This module aims to be used with simple, docker only based hosts.

  Prefer to use `kubernetes-*` modules only for kubernetes infrastructure
  while it does not make sens to monitor Docker in such environment and this will
  lead to duplicated detectors and alerts.
