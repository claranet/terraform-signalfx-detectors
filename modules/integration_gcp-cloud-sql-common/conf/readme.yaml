  ### Memory

  Memory forecast detector is disabled by default because considered as legacy.

  Indeed, it has been created to detect memory leak which has been fixed long time ago and never observed again.

  ### Disk

  Cloud SQL 2nd generation provides the [automatic storage increase](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/instance-settings#automatic-storage-increase-2ndgen) feature.

  The default behavior of this module assume this option is enabled while this is true by default:

  - Disk forecast detector is disabled by default because useless
  - Disk utilization detector is enabled for safety but with high thresholds
      - `86%` is the minimum threshold to expand disk of 50GB capacity
      - `97.5%` is the maximum threshold to expand disk of 1000GB capacity

  It is recommended to decrease these thresholds for instances where this option is disabled (or unavailable for first generation).

  To achieve that, this is possible to source twice this module with `filtering_custom` to filter only relevant databases for each scenario:

  ```hcl
  module "signalfx-detectors-cloud-gcp-cloud-sql-common-manual-storage" {
    source = "github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors.git//cloud/gcp/cloud-sql/common"

    environment   = var.environment
    notifications = [var.slack_notification]

    # We define prefix to show the difference with the detectors of the other module in the ui
    prefixes         = ["1st-gen"]
    # We keep default filtering policy here, we just want to append additional filter to it
    filtering_append = true
    # We define the additional filter to include first gen sql instances
    filtering_custom = "filter('database_id', '*first-gen*')"
    # Now we are sure detectors only apply on first gen we can lower thresholds
    disk_utilization_threshold_critical = 90
    disk_utilization_threshold_warning = 80
  }

  module "signalfx-detectors-cloud-gcp-cloud-sql-common-auto-storage" {
    source = "github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors.git//cloud/gcp/cloud-sql/common"

    environment   = var.environment
    notifications = [var.slack_notification]

    # We keep default filtering policy here, we just want to append additional filter to it
    filtering_append = true
    # We define the additional filter to exclude first gen sql instances
    filtering_custom = "(not filter('database_id', '*first-gen*'))"
  }

  ```
