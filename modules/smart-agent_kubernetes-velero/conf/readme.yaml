  ### Monitors

  This monitor is only available for agent `>= 5.5.5` but it is basically a wrapper around [prometheus exporter
  monitor](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/main/docs/monitors/prometheus-exporter.md) to filter important
  metrics while prometheus metrics are considered as custom metrics which could have an impact on SignalFx billing.

  You must configure it for every velero deployments so this is almost sure you will need to use [service
  discovery](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/main/docs/auto-discovery.md) to do it dynamically.

  Detectors in this module will at least require these metrics:

  * `velero_backup_partial_failure_total`
  * `velero_backup_deletion_failure_total`
  * `velero_backup_failure_total`
  * `velero_volume_snapshot_failure_total`
  * `velero_backup_success_total`

  There are collected by default by `velero` monitor but you have to enable them if you use `prometheus-exporter`.

  ### Velero

  These detectors use prometheus metrics from [Velero](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero).

  They should be enabled by default but be sure to enable the following flag:

  * `metrics.enabled=true`

  ### Examples

  Here is an example of SignalFx agent configuration with discovery rule:

  ```yaml
  monitors:
    - type: prometheus/velero
      discoveryRule: container_image =~ "velero" && port == 8085
      port: 8085
  ```

notes: |
  You can enable more metrics not used in this module for metrology or troubleshooting purposes:
  ```yaml
  monitors:
    - type: prometheus/velero
      discoveryRule: container_image =~ "velero" && port == 8085
      port: 8085
      datapointsToExclude:
        - metricNames:
          - '*'
          - '!velero_backup_partial_failure_total'
          - '!velero_backup_deletion_failure_total'
          - '!velero_backup_failure_total'
          - '!velero_volume_snapshot_failure_total'
          - '!velero_backup_success_total'
          - '!velero_restore_success_total'
  ```

  It uses whitelist [filtering](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/main/docs/filtering.md)
  to keep only interesting metrics. The last one is not required by this module.

  You can replace `prometheus/velero` by `prometheus-exporter` to make this module works
  with agent version prior `5.5.5`.
