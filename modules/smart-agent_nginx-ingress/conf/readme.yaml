  ### Agent

  Here is the official [main 
  documentation](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/integrations-reference/integrations.kubernetes.html) for 
  kubernetes including the `signalfx-agent` installation which must be installed as 
  [daemonset](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/) on your cluster.

  ### Monitors

  The detectors in this module are based on metrics reported by the following monitors:

  * [prometheus/nginx-ingress](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/monitors/prometheus-nginx-ingress.html)

  This monitor is only available for agent `>= 5.5.5` but it is basically a wrapper around [prometheus exporter 
  monitor](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/monitors/prometheus-exporter.html) to filter important 
  metrics while prometheus metrics are considered as custom metrics which could have an impact on SignalFx billing.

  You must configure it for every ingress deployments so this is almost sure you will need to use [service 
  discovery](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/auto-discovery.html) to do it dynamically.

  Detectors in this module will at least require these metrics:

  * `nginx_ingress_controller_requests`
  * `nginx_ingress_controller_ingress_upstream_latency_seconds`

  There are collected by default by `nginx-ingress` monitor but you have to enable them if you use `prometheus-exporter`.

  ### Nginx Ingress Controller

  Prometheus metrics from [Nginx Ingress Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) are only available for 
  version `>= 0.16`. For older versions you have to use 
  [prometheus/nginx-vts](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/monitors/prometheus-nginx-vts.html) to collect 
  metrics which will not be compatible with this module.

  Enable the following flags in the Nginx Ingress Controller chart:

  * `controller.stats.enabled=true`
  * `controller.metrics.enabled=true`

  ### Examples

  Here is an example of SignalFx agent configuration with discovery rule:

  ```yaml
  monitors:
    - type: prometheus/nginx-ingress
      discoveryRule: container_image =~ "nginx-ingress-controller" && port == 10254
      port: 10254
  ```

notes: |
  You can enable more metrics not used in this module for metrology or troubleshooting purposes:
  ```yaml
  monitors:
    - type: prometheus/nginx-ingress
      discoveryRule: container_image =~ "nginx-ingress-controller" && port == 10254
      port: 10254
      sendAllMetrics: true
      datapointsToExclude:
        - metricNames:
          - '*'
          - '!nginx_ingress_controller_requests'
          - '!nginx_ingress_controller_ingress_upstream_latency_seconds'
          - '!nginx_ingress_controller_nginx_process_cpu_seconds_total'
          - '!nginx_ingress_controller_nginx_process_virtual_memory_bytes'
          - '!nginx_ingress_controller_nginx_process_resident_memory_bytes'
  ```

  It uses whitelist [filtering](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/filtering.html) 
  to keep only interesting metrics. Only the first two are required by this module.

  You can replace `prometheus/nginx-ingress` by `prometheus-exporter` to make this module works 
  with agent version prior `5.5.5`.
