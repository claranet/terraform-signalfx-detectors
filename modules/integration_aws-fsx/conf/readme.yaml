  ### About filtering
  #

  Unlike other AWS services, the tags defined by user on FSx are not fetched by SignalFx AWS
  integration as dimensions. This is why we cannot filter on [the aws tagging
  convention](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Tagging-convention#aws).

  Instead, we use the dimension `FileSystemId` as default filtering policy which allow you to
  specify an FSx to monitor from `fsx_id` variable. In this case, you could have to leverage [multiple
  instances](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Guidance#Multiple-instances)
  of this module to monitor different FSx providing different value for this `fsx_id`. Else, its
  default value `*` will monitor all FSx.

  ### About `Percent write throughput` and `Percent read throughput` detectors

  These detectors are disabled by default but they can be useful to monitor
  the part of each type (read/write) usage over the total usage in specific context.
  Threshold for these detectors must be set based on customer's context.
  See CloudWatch to determine values.
