## How to use this module?

This directory defines a [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) 
[module](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/usage.html) you can use in your
existing [stack](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Getting-started#stack) by adding a 
`module` configuration and setting its `source` parameter to URL of this folder:

```hcl
module "signalfx-detectors-network-dns" {
  source = "github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors.git//network/dns?ref={revision}"

  environment   = var.environment
  notifications = local.notifications
}
```

Note the following parameters:

* `source`: Use this parameter to specify the URL of the module. The double slash (`//`) is intentional  and required. 
  Terraform uses it to specify subfolders within a Git repo (see [module
  sources](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/sources.html)). The `ref` parameter specifies a specific Git tag in
  this repository. It is recommended to use the latest "pinned" version in place of `{revision}`. Avoid using a branch 
  like `master` except for testing purpose. Note that every modules in this repository are available on the Terraform 
  [registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/claranet/detectors/signalfx) and we recommend using it as source 
  instead of `git` which is more flexible but less future-proof.

* `environment`: Use this parameter to specify the 
  [environment](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Getting-started#environment) used by this 
  instance of the module.
  Its value will be added to the `prefixes` list at the start of the [detector 
  name](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Templating#example).
  In general, it will also be used in `filter-tags` sub-module to apply a
  [filtering](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Guidance#filtering) based on our default 
  [tagging convention](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Tagging-convention) by default.

* `notifications`: Use this parameter to define where alerts should be sent depending on their severity. It consists 
  of a Terraform [object](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/types.html#object-) where each key represents an 
  available [detector rule severity](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/detect-alert/set-up-detectors.html#severity) 
  and its value is a list of recipients. Every recipients must respect the [detector notification 
  format](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/splunk-terraform/signalfx/latest/docs/resources/detector#notification-format).
  Check the [notification binding](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Notifications-binding) 
  documentation to understand the recommended role of each severity.

There are other Terraform [variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html) in 
[variables.tf](variables.tf) so check their description to customize the detectors behavior to fit your needs. Most of them are 
common [variables](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Variables).
The [guidance](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Guidance) documentation will help you to use 
common mechanims provided by the modules like [multi 
instances](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Guidance#Multiple-instances).

Feel free to explore the [wiki](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki) for more information about 
general usage of this repository.

## What are the available detectors in this module?

This module creates the following SignalFx detectors which could contain one or multiple alerting rules:

* DNS heartbeat
* DNS query time
* DNS query result

## How to collect required metrics?

This module uses metrics available from 
[monitors](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/monitors/_monitor-config.html)
available in the [SignalFx Smart 
Agent](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent). Check the "Related documentation" section for more 
information including the official documentation of this monitor.


There is no SignalFx official integration for `dns` but there is still a 
[monitor](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/monitors/telegraf-dns.html) to use.

### Monitors

This monitor is only available from agent version `>= 5.2.1`.
