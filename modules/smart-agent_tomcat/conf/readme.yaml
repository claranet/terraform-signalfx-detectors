  There is no SignalFx official integration for `tomcat` but there is still a 
  [monitor](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/monitors/collectd-genericjmx.html) to use.

  ### Agent

  The agent requires to [Java 
  plugin](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/integrations-reference/integrations.java.html) 
  for Collectd which is already installed in the [SignalFx Smart 
  Agent](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/).

  ### Monitors
  
  This monitor is only available from agent version `>= 5.5.5` but you can use `genericjmx` monitor for 
  previous versions with defining the [same 
  mBeans](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/master/pkg/monitors/collectd/tomcat/mbeans.go) in 
  `mBeanDefinitions` parameter.

  ### JMX

  This module uses the common Java runtime metrics for every JVM based applications.

  You must [enable JMX Remote](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/monitoring.html#Enabling_JMX_Remote) 
  on your `tomcat` server(s).

notes: |
  You can collect more metrics than used in this module defining `mBeanDefinitions` parameter on your monitor 
  configuration for metrology or troubleshooting purposes.

  You can use `genericjmx` module as complement to this one to monitor generic JMX metrics.
