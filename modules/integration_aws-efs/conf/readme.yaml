  We are using metrics from the
  [AWS/EFS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/efs-metrics.html) namespace
notes: |
  ### About filtering

  Unlike other AWS services, the tags defined by user on EFS are not fetched by SignalFx AWS
  integration as dimensions. This is why we cannot filter on [the aws tagging
  convention](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Tagging-convention#aws).

  Instead, we use the dimension `FileSystemId` as default filtering policy which allow you to
  specify an EFS to monitor from `efs_id` variable. In this case, you could have to leverage [multiple
  instances](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Guidance#Multiple-instances)
  of this module to monitor different EFS providing different value for this `efs_id`. Else, its
  default value `*` will monitor all EFS.

  ### About `Percent of IO Limit` detector

  The used `PercentIOLimit` metric is only submitted for General Purpose mode so this
  detectors does basically nothing for Max I/O performance mode EFS.

  ### About `Used Space` detector

  The **default EFS limit** (for space) is **8.0E**.
  Threshold for these detectors must be set based on customer's context.
  See CloudWatch to determine values.

  ### About `Percent write throughput` and `Percent read throughput` detectors

  These detectors are disabled by default but they can be useful to monitor
  the part of each type (read/write) usage over the total usage in specific context.
  Threshold for these detectors must be set based on customer's context.
  See CloudWatch to determine values.
