  ### Kubernetes Workloads Count
  This detector allows to set a custom limit on the total count of workloads configured on a Kubernetes cluster. This represents the sum of deployments, replicasets, statefulsets and daemonsets desired.
  It can allow you set a capacity limit and be warned when it has been reached.

  The following namespaces are excluded:
    * ara
    * bastions
    * gitlab-runner
    * ingress-nginx
    * logging
    * monitoring
    * kube-system
    * kubernetes-replicator
