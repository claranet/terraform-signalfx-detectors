  ### Capacity Units

  To properly calculate the `capacity_units_threshold_major` please refer to the Microsoft documentation about [CapacityUnits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-autoscaling-zone-redundant)

  ```
  Each instance is roughly equivalent to 10 additional reserved Capacity Units.
  ```

  If you're enabling autoscaling on your application gateway, default instance count is 20, which means 200 Capacity Units.
