  ### About filtering
  #

  Unlike other AWS services, the tags defined by user on FSx are not fetched by SignalFx AWS
  integration as dimensions. This is why we cannot filter on [the aws tagging
  convention](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Tagging-convention#aws).

  Instead, we use the other dimensions:

  * `FileSystemId` as filtering policy which allow you to specify an FSx to monitor 
  from `fsx_id` variable. In this case, you could have to leverage [multiple
  instances](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Guidance#Multiple-instances)
  of this module to monitor different FSx providing different value for this `fsx_id`. Else, its
  default value `*` will monitor all FSx.

  * `aws_account_id` as filtering policy which allow you to specify the FSx's owner to monitor 
  from `aws_account_id` variable.

  * `aws_region` as filtering policy which allow you to specify the FSx's region to monitor 
  from `aws_region` variable.
