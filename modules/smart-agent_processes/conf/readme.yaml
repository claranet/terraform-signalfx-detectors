    url: 'https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/monitors/collectd-processes.html'

source_doc: |
  There is no SignalFx official integration for `processes` but there is still a 
  [monitor](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/monitors/collectd-processes.html) to use.

notes: |
  By default, only `critical` rule is enabled. This allows the detector to check if the service has, at least, 
  one process running.

  Optionally, this is possible to enable `warning` rule to check if the service has a minimal amount of process 
  running (i.e. I need 5 "foo" processes for my api to run correctly, so I will update 
  `processes_threshold_warning` to `5` and `processes_disabled_warning` to `null`).
