  - name: Smart Agent monitor
    url: 'https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/main/docs/monitors/collectd-processes.md'

source_doc: |
  There is no SignalFx official integration for `processes` but there is still a
  [monitor](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/main/docs/monitors/collectd-processes.md) to use.

notes: |
  By default, only `critical` rule is enabled. This allows the detector to check if the service has, at least,
  one process running.

  Optionally, this is possible to enable `warning` rule to check if the service has a minimal amount of process
  running (i.e. I need 5 "foo" processes for my api to run correctly, so I will update
  `processes_threshold_warning` to `5` and `processes_disabled_warning` to `null`).
