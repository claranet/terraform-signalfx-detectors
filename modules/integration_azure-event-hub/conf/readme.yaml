  ### About filtering

  Unlike other Azure services, the tags defined by user on Event Hubs are not fetched by SignalFx Azure

  convention](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Tagging-convention#azure).

  ### About warning default values

  Basic customer's case seems to report values beetween 0 and 5% in a nominal situation.
