  ### About filtering

  Unlike other Azure services, the tags defined by user on Event Hubs are not fetched by SignalFx Azure
  integration as dimensions. This is why we cannot filter on [the azure tagging
  convention](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Tagging-convention#azure).

  ### About `throttled_requests` detector

  Basic customer's case seems to report values between 0 and 5% in a nominal situation so the default warning threshold has been set to `5`.
