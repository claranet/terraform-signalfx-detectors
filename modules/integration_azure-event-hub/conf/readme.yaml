  ### About filtering

  Unlike other Azure services, the tags defined by user on Event Hubs are not fetched by SignalFx Azure
  integration as dimensions. This is why we cannot filter on [the azure tagging
  convention](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Tagging-convention#azure).
  In this case, you could have to leverage multiple instances of this module to monitor different Event Hubs providing
  different value for this entity_name. Else, its default value * will monitor all Event Hubs.

  ### About warning default values

  Basic customer's case seems to report values beetween 0 and 5% in a nominal situation.
