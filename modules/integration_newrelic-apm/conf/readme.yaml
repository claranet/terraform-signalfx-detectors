notes: |
  * The NewRelic integration from SignalFx still uses the deprecated REST API v1.
  * It also generate too many metrics all considered as custom which could have a big
  impact in the SignalFx billing so you have to filter as much as possible to avoid that.
  * Sadly, the `errors_per_minute` filter is not available so the `errors` detector will
  not work except if you do not filter on `type` which is dangerous for billing, so the
  detector works and is available but we do not recommend until the integration supports
  this filter.
  * The `apdex` detector could work with a filter on `Apdex` metric and will not generate
  too many metrics
