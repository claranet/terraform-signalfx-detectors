notes: |
  Failover will be obviously not available on replica Cloud SQL instances.

  Saldy there is no way to automatically filter only Cloud SQL master instances.

  While Cloud SQL console automatically append `-replica` suffix to replica instances names,
  this module use it by default to exclude them but you can change it if needed:

  ```
  module "signalfx-detectors-cloud-gcp-cloud-sql-common-failover" {
    source = "github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors.git//cloud/gcp/cloud-sql/common/failover"

    environment   = var.environment
    notifications = [local.slack_notification]
    filter_custom_includes = ["project_id:${var.project_id}"]
    filter_custom_excludes = ["database_id:*-rr"]
  }
  ```
