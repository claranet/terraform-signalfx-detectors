## How to use this module?

This directory defines a [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) 
[module](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/usage.html) you can use in your
existing [stack](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Getting-started#stack) by adding a 
`module` configuration and setting its `source` parameter to URL of this folder:

```hcl
module "signalfx-detectors-cloud-gcp-cloud-sql-common-failover" {
  source = "github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors.git//cloud/gcp/cloud-sql/common/failover?ref={revision}"

  environment    = var.environment
  notifications  = local.notifications
  gcp_project_id = "fillme"
}
```

Note the following parameters:

* `source`: Use this parameter to specify the URL of the module. The double slash (`//`) is intentional  and required. 
  Terraform uses it to specify subfolders within a Git repo (see [module
  sources](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/sources.html)). The `ref` parameter specifies a specific Git tag in
  this repository. It is recommended to use the latest "pinned" version in place of `{revision}`. Avoid using a branch 
  like `master` except for testing purpose. Note that every modules in this repository are available on the Terraform 
  [registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/claranet/detectors/signalfx) and we recommend using it as source 
  instead of `git` which is more flexible but less future-proof.

* `environment`: Use this parameter to specify the 
  [environment](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Getting-started#environment) used by this 
  instance of the module.
  Its value will be added to the `prefixes` list at the start of the [detector 
  name](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Templating#example).
  In general, it will also be used in `filter-tags` sub-module to apply a
  [filtering](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Guidance#filtering) based on our default 
  [tagging convention](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Tagging-convention) by default.

* `notifications`: Use this parameter to define where alerts should be sent depending on their severity. It consists 
  of a Terraform [object](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/types.html#object-) where each key represents an 
  available [detector rule severity](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/detect-alert/set-up-detectors.html#severity) 
  and its value is a list of recipients. Every recipients must respect the [detector notification 
  format](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/splunk-terraform/signalfx/latest/docs/resources/detector#notification-format).
  Check the [notification binding](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Notifications-binding) 
  documentation to understand the recommended role of each severity.

There are other Terraform [variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html) in 
[variables.tf](variables.tf) so check their description to customize the detectors behavior to fit your needs. Most of them are 
common [variables](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Variables).
The [guidance](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Guidance) documentation will help you to use 
common mechanims provided by the modules like [multi 
instances](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Guidance#Multiple-instances).

Feel free to explore the [wiki](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki) for more information about 
general usage of this repository.

## What are the available detectors in this module?

This module creates the following SignalFx detectors which could contain one or multiple alerting rules:

* GCP Cloud SQL failover

## How to collect required metrics?

This module uses metrics available from 
the [GCP integration](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/google-cloud-platform.html) configurable 
with this Terraform [module](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-integrations/tree/master/cloud/gcp).




## Notes

Failover will be obviously not available on replica Cloud SQL instances.

Saldy there is no way to automatically filter only Cloud SQL master instances.

While Cloud SQL console automatically append `-replica` suffix to replica instances names,
this module use it by default to exclude them but you can change it if needed:

```
module "signalfx-detectors-cloud-gcp-cloud-sql-common-failover" {
  source = "github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors.git//cloud/gcp/cloud-sql/common/failover"

  environment   = var.environment
  notifications = [local.slack_notification]
  filter_custom_includes = ["project_id:${var.project_id}"]
  filter_custom_excludes = ["database_id:*-rr"]
}
```
