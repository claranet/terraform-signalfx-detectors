  System disk weighted io usage detector is disabled by default. It may be useful in some specific cases where system disk io usage detector show usage above 100% because of multi-queued IOs due to device or driver, please enable it only if you understand what it implies. See [Linux kernel documentation](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/iostats.html).

  You must explicitely enable collection of those metrics on Agent:
  - system.disk.io_time
  - system.disk.weighted_io_time
