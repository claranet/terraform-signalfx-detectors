  There is no one official integration for system generic metrics but instead multiple monitors to fetch 
  all useful metrics from `cpu`, `load`, `filesystems` and `memory`.

  ### Monitors

  You have to enable the `inodes` group in `extraGroups` parameter of the `filesystems` monitor configuration (only 
  available for `Linux`) to work with the inodes detector.

  It is highly recommended to define `perCPU: true` in the `load` monitor configuration to get the __ratio__ of load 
  per CPU/core which makes more sens for the generic load detector.
  For `Helm` deployment on `Kubernetes`, you can use `loadPerCPU` option available from `1.2.0` version.
