  There is no one official integration for system generic metrics but instead multiple monitors to fetch
  all useful metrics from `cpu`, `load`, `filesystems` and `memory`.

  ### Monitors

  #### Inodes

  To use inodes based detectors you must enable the `inodes` group in `extraGroups` parameter of the `filesystems` monitor configuration

  Inodes metrics areonly available for `Linux`).

  #### Space

  You can exclude squashfs filesystems from the collect using `fsTypes: ["!squashfs"]` parameter in the agent configuration.
  But we exclude it explicitly in related detector for safety to prevent any alert on this filesystem type.

  #### Load

  You have two choices to use load based detectors:
    - either keep the `per_cpu_enabled` enabled (variable default value) __and__ define `perCPU: true` in the [load monitor](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/monitors/load.html) configuration (for Kubernetes, you can use `loadPerCPU` option from the Helm chart available from `1.2.0` version).
    - or override the `per_cpu_enabled` to `false` __and__ keep the default configuration for the [load monitor](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/monitors/load.html) with `perCPU: false` or not defined

  In both cases, the goal is to get alerts based on the __ratio__ of load by dividing the original load per the number of CPU/cores which is the only way to get generic and relevant alerts for load.
  It mainly depends if you want to collect 2 metrics instead of 1 and if you want the load one to be raw or already averaged.
