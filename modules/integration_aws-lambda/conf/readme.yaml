notes: |
  ### About `pct_errors` detector

  * This detector uses a `latest` extrapolation to force the alert to remain until a new execution of the same lambda function
  happens in success. Depending on the frequency at which the function executes, the alert may take time to self resolve.

  ### About `invocations` detector

  * The goal of this detector is to trigger an alert if a function did not execute at least the number of `invocations_threshold_major`
  (once by default) on the timeframe defined by `invocations_transformation_function`. It could be useful to ensure that a regular
  function has been run as expected like a cron based function. You should disable it for erratic or event based function (except
  if you expect to see enough events on your timeframe)
