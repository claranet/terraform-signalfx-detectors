  documentation](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/integrations-reference/integrations.mongodb.html) 
  in addition to the monitor one which it uses.

  ### Monitors

  The `collectd/mongodb` monitor requires to enable the following `extraMetrics`:

  * `gauge.connections.available`
  * `counter.asserts.regular`
  * `counter.asserts.warning`
  * `gauge.repl.max_lag`
  * `gauge.repl.active_nodes`
  * `gauge.repl.is_primary_node`

  The 3 last ones enabled by default since agent version `v5.5.6`.

  This is highly recommended to configure the monitor on __all__ members of a replicaset 
  to fetch metrics from both the primary and the secondaries which all have their own stats.
  This is the only way to make the replicaset related detectors to work.

  ### Examples
  
  ```yaml
    - type: collectd/mongodb
      host: &mongoHost localhost
      port: &mongoPort 27017
      username: user
      password: pass
      databases:
        - admin
      # Uncomment only if mysql server is not on the same host as signalfx agent
      #disableHostDimensions: true
      extraDimensions:
        # Uncomment only if you enabled `disableHostDimensions` or for "serverless" mode.
        #host: *mongoHost
      # You should not have to change lines below
      extraMetrics:
        - gauge.connections.available
        - counter.asserts.regular
        - counter.asserts.warning
        # Only required if agent <= 5.5.5:
        - gauge.repl.max_lag
        - gauge.repl.active_nodes
        - gauge.repl.is_primary_node
  ```

notes: |
  * This is mandatory for "primary" and "secondary" detectors because 
  they need the information of every member of a replicaset to determine 
  if there is a problem. Indeed, they group by the replicaset to know if 
  there is, at least, one master and two scondaries.

  * The heartbeat detector is also aggregated by replicaset (`cluster`) by 
  default to avoid alert for each single member disapearance.

  * Every other detectors do not use any aggegation because this is more 
  flexible and they do not require it to work. But feel free to change 
  the `aggregation_functions` variables for these tree or others to fit 
  your environment.
