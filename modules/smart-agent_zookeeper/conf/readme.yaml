  Check the [integration 
  documentation](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/integrations-reference/integrations.zookeeper.html) 
  in addition to the monitor one which it uses.

  ### Monitors

  The `collectd/zookeeper` monitor requires to enable the following `extraMetrics`:

  * `gauge.zk_outstanding_requests`

  ### Examples

  ```yaml
    - type: collectd/zookeeper
      host: localhost
      port: 2181
      name: "zk" # set the value of `plugin_instance` dimension
      extraMetrics:
        - gauge.zk_outstanding_requests
        - gauge.zk_service_health
        - gauge.zk_is_leader
  ```

  Only the first one is used in this module for now but others seem highly valuable for metrology 
  or trousbleshooting purpose.
