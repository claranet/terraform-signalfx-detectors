  ### Monitor

  The detector of this module is based on metrics reported by the [collectd/systemd](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/monitors/collectd-systemd.html) monitor.

  For example, to monitor the `toto.service` and `titi.service` on your host, your SignalFX agent should look like this:

  ```yaml
  monitors:
    …
    - type: collectd/systemd
      services:
        - toto
        - titi
    …
  ```
