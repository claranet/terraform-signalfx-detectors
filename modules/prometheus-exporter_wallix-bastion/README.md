## How to use this module?

This directory defines a [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) 
[module](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/usage.html) you can use in your
existing [stack](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Getting-started#stack) by adding a 
`module` configuration and setting its `source` parameter to URL of this folder:

```hcl
module "signalfx-detectors-prometheus-exporter-wallix-bastion" {
  source = "github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors.git//modules/prometheus-exporter_wallix-bastion?ref={revision}"

  environment   = var.environment
  notifications = local.notifications
}
```

Note the following parameters:

* `source`: Use this parameter to specify the URL of the module. The double slash (`//`) is intentional  and required. 
  Terraform uses it to specify subfolders within a Git repo (see [module
  sources](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/sources.html)). The `ref` parameter specifies a specific Git tag in
  this repository. It is recommended to use the latest "pinned" version in place of `{revision}`. Avoid using a branch 
  like `master` except for testing purpose. Note that every modules in this repository are available on the Terraform 
  [registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/claranet/detectors/signalfx) and we recommend using it as source 
  instead of `git` which is more flexible but less future-proof.

* `environment`: Use this parameter to specify the 
  [environment](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Getting-started#environment) used by this 
  instance of the module.
  Its value will be added to the `prefixes` list at the start of the [detector 
  name](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Templating#example).
  In general, it will also be used in the `filtering` internal sub-module to [apply
  filters](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Guidance#filtering) based on our default 
  [tagging convention](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Tagging-convention) by default.

* `notifications`: Use this parameter to define where alerts should be sent depending on their severity. It consists 
  of a Terraform [object](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/types.html#object-) where each key represents an 
  available [detector rule severity](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/detect-alert/set-up-detectors.html#severity) 
  and its value is a list of recipients. Every recipients must respect the [detector notification 
  format](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/splunk-terraform/signalfx/latest/docs/resources/detector#notification-format).
  Check the [notification binding](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Notifications-binding) 
  documentation to understand the recommended role of each severity.

These 3 parameters alongs with all variables defined in [common-variables.tf](common-variables.tf) are common to all 
[modules](../) in this repository. Other variables, specific to this module, are available in 
[variables-gen.tf](variables-gen.tf).
In general, the default configuration "works" but all of these Terraform 
[variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html) make it possible to 
customize the detectors behavior to better fit your needs.

Most of them represent usual tips and rules detailled in the 
[guidance](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Guidance) documentation and listed in the 
common [variables](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Variables) dedicated documentation.

Feel free to explore the [wiki](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki) for more information about 
general usage of this repository.

## What are the available detectors in this module?

This module creates the following SignalFx detectors which could contain one or multiple alerting rules:

|Detector|Critical|Major|Minor|Warning|Info|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Wallix-bastion heartbeat|X|-|-|-|-|
|Wallix-bastion status|X|-|-|-|-|
|Wallix-bastion total number of current sessions|-|X|X|-|-|

## How to collect required metrics?

This module uses metrics available from 
the scraping of a server following the [OpenMetrics convention](https://openmetrics.io/) based on and compatible with [the Prometheus
exposition format](https://github.com/prometheus/docs/blob/main/content/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats.md#openmetrics-text-format).
They are generally called "Prometheus Exporter" which can be fetched by both the [SignalFx Smart Agent](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent)
thanks to its [prometheus exporter monitor](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/monitors/prometheus-exporter.html) and the
[OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector) using its [prometheus
receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/prometheusreceiver) or its derivates.


The detectors of this module uses metrics from the [wallix-bastion exporter prometheus](https://github.com/claranet/wallix_bastion_exporter).
Check its documentation to install and configure it appropriately with your Wallix Bastion instance.

### Examples

Here is a sample configuration fragment for the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) agent using
the [prometheusexec receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/prometheusexecreceiver).

```yaml
receivers:
  prometheus_exec/wallix:
    exec: /etc/otel/collector/scripts/wallix_bastion_exporter/wallix_bastion_exporter --listen-address ":{{port}}" --skip-verify
    port: 9191
    scrape_interval: 300s
    env:
      - name: WALLIX_USERNAME
        value: monitoring
      - name: WALLIX_PASSWORD
        value: my_awesome_password
processors:
  filter/wallix:
    metrics:
      include:
        match_type: regexp
        metric_names:
          - wallix_bastion.*
  resourcedetection/internal:
    detectors: [system, gce, ecs, ec2, azure]
    # Useful in combination with the prometheus receivers which set `host.name` dimension from the scrapped url but we prefer to keep the hostname where the agent runs.
    override: true
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics/wallix:
      receivers: [prometheus_exec/wallix]
      processors: [resourcedetection/internal, filter/wallix, metricstransform/wallix]
      exporters: [signalfx]
```


### Metrics


Here is the list of required metrics for detectors in this module.

* `squid_up`
* `wallix_bastion_sessions`
