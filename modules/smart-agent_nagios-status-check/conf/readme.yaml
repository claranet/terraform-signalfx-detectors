  ### Monitors

  This monitor is only available for agent `>= 5.7.1`. For prior versions, it is possible to use the
  `telegraf/exec` monitor with `nagios` parser but you will not get the script result in event.

  You can configure as many monitors as you have nagios checks to reuse but you have to define for each
  it could be useful to adapt the `intervalSeconds` for each script.

  ### Examples

  ```yaml
  globalDimensions:
    sfx_monitored: true

  - type: nagios
  intervalSeconds: 180
  command: /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_ntp_time -H pool.ntp.typhon.net -w 0.5 -c 1
  service: NTP_TIME
  extraDimensions:
    sfx_monitored: false

  - type: nagios
  intervalSeconds: 180
  command: /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_http -I google.fr -f sticky -H google.fr -s http -u / -p 80
  service: HTTP_google
  ```

  In this example, the first NTP check will not trigger any alert using default filtering convention but
  the metric and its value will be available.

notes: |
  This module has been designed to alert with the same behavior as
  [Nagios](https://nagios-plugins.org/doc/guidelines.html#AEN78), basically a gauge equal to 1, 2 and 3
  respectively triggering `WARNING`, `CRITICAL` and `UNKNOWN` alert.

  While SignalFx does not provide `Unknown` severity this module uses the `Major` severity for unknown alerts.

  The metric is named `nagios.state`.
