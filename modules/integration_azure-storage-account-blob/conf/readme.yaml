notes: |
  ### Detectors disabled by default
  The following detectors are disabled by default:
    * requests error rate
    * latency e2e

  This is due to :
    * The fact that these detectors are historically flapping.
    * This module can evolve by adding "stable" detectors and
      we need to be able to only activate (by default) the stable ones.

  Some customers may have the need to use these anymay.
