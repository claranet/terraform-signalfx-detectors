  There is no SignalFx official integration for `ntp` but there is still a
  [monitor](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/monitors/ntp.html) to use.

  ### Monitors

  This monitor is only available from agent version `>= 5.1.5`.

  Also, in contrast with all other monitors it enforce an `intervalSeconds` to `30m` minimum

notes: |
  NTP monitor has hardcoded minimal interval of 30m (https://www.pool.ntp.org/tos.html).
  As a result, the heartbeat timeframe should be higher than the other modules (`>= 3h` recommended).
  This assumes the monitor will often use public NTP servers which:

  - should not be overloaded
  - could be not enough reliable (and will cause at least 30m of null MTS)

  In the future we could improve this monitor to:

  - use 30m by default but allow configure lower interval when "internal" NTP server is used
  - add a retry mechanism to prevent missing data
