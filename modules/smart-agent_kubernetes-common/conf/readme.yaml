  ### Agent

  Here is the official [main 
  documentation](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/integrations-reference/integrations.kubernetes.html) for 
  kubernetes including the `signalfx-agent` installation which must be installed as 
  [daemonset](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/) on your cluster.

  ### Monitors

  The detectors in this module are based on metrics reported by the following monitors:

  * [kubelet-metrics](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/monitors/kubelet-metrics.html) for Kubernetes `>= 1.18`
  * [kubelet-stats](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/monitors/kubelet-stats.html) for Kubernetes `< 1.18
  * [kubernetes-cluster](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/monitors/kubernetes-cluster.html)

  [Others](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-monitors-observers.html#monitors-observers) 
  exist to increase visibility or may be in future to enrich this modules or create new ones.

  The `kubernetes-cluster` requires to enable the following `extraMetrics`:

  * `kubernetes.job.completions`
  * `kubernetes.job.active`
  * `kubernetes.job.succeeded`
  * `kubernetes.stateful_set.ready`
  * `kubernetes.stateful_set.desired`

  ### Examples

  Here is a sample configuration fragment for SignalFx Agent with `kubernetes-cluster` monitor:

  ```yaml
  monitors:
  - type: kubernetes-cluster
    extraMetrics:
      - kubernetes.job.completions
      - kubernetes.job.active
      - kubernetes.job.succeeded
      - kubernetes.stateful_set.ready
      - kubernetes.stateful_set.desired
  ```

  You can replace `kubernetes-cluster` with `openshift-cluster` you monitor Openshift Kubernetes.

  Then add the monitor `kubelet-metrics` for Kubernetes version `>= 1.18`. Example for GKE:

  ```yaml
  - type: kubelet-metrics
    kubeletAPI:
      authType: serviceAccount
    usePodsEndpoint: true
  ```

  __Note__: `usePodsEndpoint: true` allows to enhance containers metrics with `container_id` dimension.

  If you use a Kubernetes version `< 1.18` you have to replace `kubelet-metrics` monitor by `kubelet-stats`.
  Example for GKE:

  ```yaml
  - type: kubelet-stats
    kubeletAPI:
      authType: serviceAccount
    datapointsToExclude:
    - dimensions:
        container_image:
        - '*pause-amd64*'
        - 'k8s.gcr.io/pause*'
      metricNames:
        - '*'
        - '!*network*'
  ```

  Using the SignalFx [Helm](https://helm.sh/) [chart](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/deployments/k8s/helm/signalfx-agent)
  could ease the agent installation and configuration:

  ```yaml
  # Increase depending on your use case
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: 250m
      memory: 768Mi
    requests:
      cpu: 100m
      memory: 128Mi

  # Change for your kubernetes cluster name
  clusterName: "sfx-doc"

  # Change for your realm
  signalFxRealm: eu0

  # Required to use the default filtering convention
  globalDimensions:
    sfx_monitored: true
    # Change for your env
    env: sandbox

  # Required to use this module
  clusterExtraMetrics:
    - kubernetes.job.failed
    - kubernetes.stateful_set.ready
    - kubernetes.stateful_set.desired

  # Required to use "system-generic" module
  loadPerCPU: true

  # Required to use "kubernetes-volumes" module
  gatherVolumesMetrics: true

  # Example of optional monitors to add for more cool metrics
  monitors:
    - type: prometheus-exporter
      discoveryRule: container_image =~ "nginx-ingress-controller" && port == 10254
      port: 10254
      datapointsToExclude:
        - metricNames:
          - '*'
          - '!nginx_ingress_controller_requests'
          - '!nginx_ingress_controller_ingress_upstream_latency_seconds'
  ```

  __Note__: `clusterExtraMetrics` option is only available from the `1.7.1` version of the helm chart.


notes: |
  This module should suit to every kubernetes clusters full managed or not and could be complete with others 
  modules covering more data sources like `kubernetes-volumes` or use cases like `kubernetes-apiserver`.

  ### About `node_ready` detector

  * it works as for most of the "heartbeat" detectors in this repo; using state property from cloud provider to ignore alerts on host which has been terminated / stopped (i.e. autoscaling group)
  * the goal is to avoid any alert considered as normal because of host has been removed (automatically or manually)
  * but the detector will always raise alert for environment outside the cloud while we do any way to know if "not ready node" comes from stopped / terminated host or a real problem.

  ### About `job_failed` detector

  * it works only on job running from cronjob
  * this will obviously raise an alert when a job is considered as failed from kubernetes point of view. Indeed, some pods could eventually fail or retry without to mark the job as failed
  * but the alert will remain until you clean/purge jobs history. Indeed, even if a new, more recent, successful job has been running in the meantime the alert will continue until you delete the failed job

  ### About `oom_killed` detector

  * default transformation function is used to avoid the detector to flap repeatedly
  * if unset, expect the detector to send several alerts per minute
