  ### Monitor
  
  The detector of this module is based on metrics reported by the [collectd/health-checker](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/monitors/collectd-health-checker.html) monitor.

  It can monitor:
    * network port (use `health_checker_value`)
    * check json output of http requests (use `health_checker_value`)
    * http response code (use `health_checker_status`)

  For example, to monitor the network port 1234 on your host, your SignalFX agent should look like this:

  ```yaml
  monitors:
    …
    - type: collectd/health-checker
      host: 127.0.0.1
      port: 1234
      tcpCheck: true
    …
  ```

  I advise you to read the [collectd source code of health_checker.py](https://github.com/signalfx/collectd-health_checker/blob/master/health_checker.py) to understand how this monitor works.
