notes: |
  Not like the VirtualMachines module, we decided to not monitor CPU on ScaleSet because it's a non sense on something which should autoscale automatically.

  For this first version we will only check if the ScaleSet is running with at least one node (Percent CPU heartbeat).
  Next step will be to use signalFx outlier to, for example, check if all VMs in the ScaleSet use the same percent of CPU.
