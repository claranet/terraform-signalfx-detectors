  in addition to the monitor one which it uses.

  ### Monitors

  The `collectd/redis` monitor requires to enable the following `extraMetrics`:

  * `bytes.total_system_memory`
  * `bytes.maxmemory`
  * `gauge.db0_keys`

  Some of them are available since agent version `v5.4.2` like the two first.

notes: |
  * The "keyspace full" detector uses number of keys from database index 0, 
  it will not work for other databases (1-15 by default).
  This detector is disabled by default because it makes sens only when redis is used as cache.
