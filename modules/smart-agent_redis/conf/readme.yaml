  ### Monitors

  The `collectd/redis` monitor requires to enable the following `extraMetrics`:

  * `bytes.total_system_memory`
  * `bytes.maxmemory`
  * `gauge.db0_keys`

  Some of them are available since agent version `v5.4.2` like the two first.

notes: |
  * The "keyspace full" detector uses number of keys from database index 0,
  it will not work for other databases (1-15 by default).
  This detector is disabled by default because it makes sens only when redis is used as cache.
  * This module supports the `use_otel_receiver` variable in case you are monitoring Redis with otel collector.
  If set to `true`, metrics name will be updated to match otel collector defaults.
  The following detectors are not supported when `use_otel_receiver` is set to true:
    * Redis memory used over max memory
    * Redis memory used over total system memory
