## How to use this module?

This directory defines a [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
[module](https://www.terraform.io/language/modules/syntax) you can use in your
existing [stack](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Getting-started#stack) by adding a
`module` configuration and setting its `source` parameter to URL of this folder:

```hcl
module "signalfx-detectors-smart-agent-redis" {
  source = "github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors.git//modules/smart-agent_redis?ref={revision}"

  environment   = var.environment
  notifications = local.notifications
}
```

Note the following parameters:

* `source`: Use this parameter to specify the URL of the module. The double slash (`//`) is intentional  and required.
  Terraform uses it to specify subfolders within a Git repo (see [module
  sources](https://www.terraform.io/language/modules/sources)). The `ref` parameter specifies a specific Git tag in
  this repository. It is recommended to use the latest "pinned" version in place of `{revision}`. Avoid using a branch
  like `master` except for testing purpose. Note that every modules in this repository are available on the Terraform
  [registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/claranet/detectors/signalfx) and we recommend using it as source
  instead of `git` which is more flexible but less future-proof.

* `environment`: Use this parameter to specify the
  [environment](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Getting-started#environment) used by this
  instance of the module.
  Its value will be added to the `prefixes` list at the start of the [detector
  name](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Templating#example).
  In general, it will also be used in the `filtering` internal sub-module to [apply
  filters](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Guidance#filtering) based on our default
  [tagging convention](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Tagging-convention) by default.

* `notifications`: Use this parameter to define where alerts should be sent depending on their severity. It consists
  of a Terraform [object](https://www.terraform.io/language/expressions/type-constraints#object) where each key represents an available
  [detector rule severity](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/alerts-detectors-notifications/create-detectors-for-alerts.html#severity)
  and its value is a list of recipients. Every recipients must respect the [detector notification
  format](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/splunk-terraform/signalfx/latest/docs/resources/detector#notification-format).
  Check the [notification binding](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Notifications-binding)
  documentation to understand the recommended role of each severity.

These 3 parameters alongs with all variables defined in [common-variables.tf](common-variables.tf) are common to all
[modules](../) in this repository. Other variables, specific to this module, are available in
[variables.tf](variables.tf).
In general, the default configuration "works" but all of these Terraform
[variables](https://www.terraform.io/language/values/variables) make it possible to
customize the detectors behavior to better fit your needs.

Most of them represent usual tips and rules detailled in the
[guidance](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Guidance) documentation and listed in the
common [variables](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Variables) dedicated documentation.

Feel free to explore the [wiki](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki) for more information about
general usage of this repository.

## What are the available detectors in this module?

This module creates the following SignalFx detectors which could contain one or multiple alerting rules:

|Detector|Critical|Major|Minor|Warning|Info|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Redis heartbeat|X|-|-|-|-|
|Redis evicted keys rate of change|X|X|-|-|-|
|Redis expired keys rate of change|X|X|-|-|-|
|Redis blocked client rate|-|-|X|X|-|
|Redis keyspace seems full|-|X|-|-|-|
|Redis memory used over max memory (if configured)|X|X|-|-|-|
|Redis memory used over total system memory|X|X|-|-|-|
|Redis memory fragmentation ratio (excessive fragmentation)|X|X|-|-|-|
|Redis memory fragmentation ratio (missing memory)|X|X|-|-|-|
|Redis rejected connections (maxclient reached)|X|X|-|-|-|
|Redis hitrate|X|X|-|-|-|

## How to collect required metrics?

This module deploys detectors using metrics reported by the
[SignalFx Smart Agent Monitors](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent#monitors).

Even if the [Smart Agent is deprecated](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/main/docs/smartagent-deprecation-notice.md)
it remains an efficient, lightweight and simple monitoring agent which still works fine.
See the [official documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/smart-agent/smart-agent-resources.html) for more information
about this agent.
You might find the related following documentations useful:
- the global level [agent configuration](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/main/docs/config-schema.md)
- the [monitor level configuration](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/main/docs/monitor-config.md)
- the internal [agent configuration tips](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Guidance#agent-configuration).
- the full list of [monitors available](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/main/docs/monitors) with their own specific documentation.

In addition, all of these monitors are still available in the [Splunk Otel Collector](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector),
the Splunk [distro of OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/distributions/) which replaces SignalFx Smart Agent,
thanks to the internal [Smart Agent Receiver](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/tree/main/internal/receiver/smartagentreceiver).

As a result:
- any SignalFx Smart Agent monitor are compatible with the new agent OpenTelemetry Collector and related modules in this repository keep `smart-agent` as source name.
- any OpenTelemetry receiver not based on an existing Smart Agent monitor is not available from old agent so related modules in this repository use `otel-collector` as source name.


Check the [Related documentation](#related-documentation) section for more detailed and specific information about this module dependencies.

### Monitors

The `collectd/redis` monitor requires to enable the following `extraMetrics`:

* `bytes.total_system_memory`
* `bytes.maxmemory`
* `gauge.db0_keys`

Some of them are available since agent version `v5.4.2` like the two first.


### Metrics


To filter only required metrics for the detectors of this module, add the
[datapointsToExclude](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/gdi/smart-agent/smart-agent-resources.html#filtering-data-using-the-smart-agent)
parameter to the corresponding monitor configuration:

```yaml
    datapointsToExclude:
      - metricNames:
        - '*'
        - '!bytes.maxmemory'
        - '!bytes.total_system_memory'
        - '!bytes.used_memory'
        - '!bytes.used_memory_rss'
        - '!counter.evicted_keys'
        - '!counter.expired_keys'
        - '!counter.rejected_connections'
        - '!derive.keyspace_hits'
        - '!derive.keyspace_misses'
        - '!gauge.blocked_clients'
        - '!gauge.connected_clients'
        - '!gauge.db0_keys'

```

## Notes

* The "keyspace full" detector uses number of keys from database index 0,
it will not work for other databases (1-15 by default).
This detector is disabled by default because it makes sens only when redis is used as cache.
