  There is no SignalFx official integration for `varnish` but there is still a
  [monitor](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/monitors/telegraf-varnish.html) to use.

  ### Monitors

  This monitor is only available from agent version `>= 5.5.0`

  It uses the `varnishstat` command which must be installed on the varnish host next to the `signalfx-agent`
  which must be able to run this command:

  ```bash
  usermod -a -G varnish signalfx-agent
  ```

  ### Varnish

  For varnish 4 only:

  In the **/etc/default/varnishncsa** file:
  ```
  VARNISHNCSA_ENABLED=1
  ```

  Following by :

  ```bash
  systemctl start varnishncsa.service
  systemctl enable varnishncsa.service
  ```
