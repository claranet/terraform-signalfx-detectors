notes: |
  * The NewRelic integration from SignalFx still uses the deprecated [REST API 
  v1](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/rest-api-v1-deprecated/new-relic-rest-api-v1).
  * It also generate too many metrics all considered as custom which could have a big 
  impact in the SignalFx billing so you have to filter as much as possible to avoid that.
  * Sadly, the `errors_per_minute` filter is not available so the `errors` detector will 
  not work except if you do not filter on `type` which is dangerous for billing, so the 
  detector works and is available but we do not recommend until the integration supports 
  this filter.
  * The `apdex` detector could work with a filter on `Apdex` metric and will not generate 
  too many metrics
